Working with the micro:bit
==========================

Pytch supports connecting micro:bit boards and interacting with them from your
Pytch programs. V2 micro:bit boards have additional features not available on V1
boards, see :ref:`microbit-usage` for more information. V1 boards may also experience
more issues during use due to their hardware.
